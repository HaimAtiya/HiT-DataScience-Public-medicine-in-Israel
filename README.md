# Public medicine in Israel

In this project I would like to explore the waiting times for doctors in public medicine in Israel.  
Public medicine in Israel is considered very good,  
but lacks when it comes to waiting times for doctors.  
Nowadays, in order to get a specialist doctor (such as a neurologist, cardiologist, etc.)  
it is usually necessary to wait a long time until an appointment with a doctor,  
sometimes it is a very valuable time that can cost a human life.  

In this project I would like to check what causes a long waiting time for doctors and whether it can be shortened.
